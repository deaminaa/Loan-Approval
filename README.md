Project Overview
Predicting loan default risk is crucial for financial institutions to minimize losses and manage credit risk effectively. This project uses machine learning to classify loan applications as either "default" or "non-default," providing a risk evaluation based on historical data.

Key Objectives
Analyze and preprocess loan data.
Engineer features to capture essential data patterns.
Implement hyperparameter tuning and class imbalance handling to optimize the model.
Features and Data
The dataset includes various financial and demographic attributes such as:

Loan Grade: Ordinal data from A (worst) to G (best).
Credit History: Past loan performance metrics.
Income and Employment Details: Applicant's financial background.
Loan Amount and Interest Rate: Specific loan information.
Preprocessing Steps
To ensure data quality and enhance model performance, the following preprocessing steps were implemented:

Handling Missing Values: Imputation for missing values where necessary.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Ordinal encoding for loan_grade based on risk level.
Scaling and Standardization: Standardized numerical columns for uniformity.
Class Imbalance Handling: Implemented scale_pos_weight in model training to address class imbalance.
Modeling Approach
Several machine learning models were tested, with extensive hyperparameter tuning using Optuna. The key models explored include:

XGBoost: Optimized using Optuna for hyperparameter tuning, with an emphasis on improving AUC.
Additional Techniques: Class imbalance strategies and feature engineering were implemented to optimize model outcomes.
Evaluation
The model is primarily evaluated on AUC (Area Under the Curve), as it captures the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity for imbalanced data.

Usage
To run the model, follow these steps:

Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loan-prediction
cd loan-prediction
Install required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebook to train and evaluate the model:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook loan-prediction.ipynb
Results
The final model achieved:

AUC: [Add value]
Precision and Recall: [Add values]
Model Insights: Feature importance indicates that [Top feature names] were the most influential in predicting default risk.
Future Work
Potential improvements and extensions to this project include:

Experimenting with other machine learning algorithms and ensemble techniques.
Implementing advanced class imbalance techniques.
Further optimizing hyperparameters with a larger parameter grid.
